Run the code below and make sure it renders as a Plotly plot.

Try changing the `color` aesthetic to one of the following variables:

- `country`
- `subject_sex`
- `race_known`

```{r}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(fivethirtyeight)

##load the biopics data
data(biopics)
biopics <- biopics %>% filter(!is.na(box_office))


out_plot <- ggplot(biopics) +
  aes(y=box_office, 
      x=year_release,
      color=type_of_subject,
      movie_title=title) + 
  geom_point()

ggplotly(out_plot)
```
