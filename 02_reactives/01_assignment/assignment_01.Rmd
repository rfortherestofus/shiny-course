Build up your dplyr statement by specifying your filter command below.

We want to filter the `year_release` variable. Specifically, we want whether a film was released by less than or equal to 2001.

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data(biopics)
```

```{r}
biopics %>%
  dplyr::filter(year_release < 2001)
```

Think about it: where would our input value go in this calculation?
